Bunnyblack is an Electrogaze Darkwave Post-Punk duo founded by Maiqqu (Maiqqu Gameboy Music) and Less (Velaut, Inside the hole), based in Sicily, Italy.
Their music is a blend of thrashing 8-bit sounds, coming from a Nintendo Gameboy, and electric instruments that confer to it a dreamy and noisy special dimension.   less
